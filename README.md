# printu-canvas-playground

## How to run
1. Clone repo
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn start`

Or...
1. Install local node server

4. Host built app on local node server

## Tests
Currently there aren't any tests implemented yet, but there are already created test files with some draft tests "todo".

### Possible changes 
1. I'd rather use [react query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/) instead of Redux with api calls and state management (in current app version).
2. I'm considering changing `*.scss` files to use directly [styled components](https://styled-components.com/)
3. For the future in case of multiple pages, forms - libraries like `React Router`, `yup`, `formik` would come in handy
